# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview - Loan Prediction Analysis

This module explained how machine learning can assist with analyzing credit card risk.  Students used Pandas and dataframes to perform data preparation, 
statiscal reasoning and machine learning practices to predict credit card risk.  

Identify target (credit risk outcome)
Identify features (attributes used in machine learning method)
Split the data - training and testing
Train the model (fit)
Make predictions
classification report


## Results 

Results TBD
There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

### Naive Random Oversampling

![Naive Random Oversampling](https://github.com/gaudiom4git/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/NaiveRandomOversampling.png)

* Balance Accuracy Score = 65.16% The False Negative = 33 which means the Model predicted credit card risk as Low Risk but 
actually those are High risk. 
* The precision of prediction using this model:Low Risk(1) is 1 and High Risk(0) is 0.01 
* The recall(sensitivity) for predicting Low Risk(1)is 0.68 and High Risk is 0.62 
* The F1 score for Low Risk is 0.81 and for high risk is 0.02 as precision for High risk is low.

### SMOTE Oversampling

![SMOTE Oversampling](https://github.com/gaudiom4git/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/SmoteOversampling.png)

* Balance Accuracy Score = 62.42% The False Negative = 36 which means the Model predicted credit card risk as Low Risk but 
actually those are High risk. 
* The precision of prediction using this model:Low Risk(1) is 1 and High Risk(0) is 0.01 
* The recall(sensitivity) for predicting Low Risk is 0.59 and High Risk is 0.66 
* The F1 score for Low Risk is higher 0.80

### Undersampling

![Undersampling](https://github.com/gaudiom4git/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Undersampling.png)

* Balance Accuracy Score = 52.75% The False Negative = 35 which means the Model predicted credit card risk as Low Risk 
but actually those are High risk. 
* The precision of prediction using this model:Low Risk(1) is 1 and High Risk(0) is 0.01 
* The recall(sensitivity) for predicting Low Risk is 0.46 and High Risk is 0.60 
* The F1 score for low Risk is higher 0.63 and high risk is 0.01

### Combination (Over and Under) Sampling-SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

![Combination Over and Under SMOTEEN](https://github.com/gaudiom4git/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/SMOTEEN.png)

* Balance Accuracy Score = 62.48% The False Negative = 25 which means the Model predicted credit card risk as Low Risk 
but actually those are High risk. 
* The precision of prediction using this model:Low Risk(1) is 1 and High Risk(0) is 0.01 
* The recall(sensitivity) for predicting Low Risk is 0.54 and High Risk is 0.71 
* The F1 score for Low Risk is higher 0.70 and high risk is 0.02

### Balanced Random Forest Classifier

![Balanced Random Forest](https://github.com/gaudiom4git/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/BalancedRandomForestClassifier.png)

* Balance Accuracy Score = 77.91% The False Negative = 30 which means the Model predicted credit card risk as Low Risk 
but actually those are High risk. 
* The precision of prediction using this model:Low Risk(1) is 1 and High Risk(0) is 0.03 
* The recall(sensitivity) for predicting Low Risk is 0.87 and High Risk is 0.70 
* The F1 score for Low Risk is higher 0.93 and high Risk is 0.06

### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

![Easy Ensemble AdaBoost](https://github.com/gaudiom4git/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/EasyEnsembleADABoost.png)

* Balance Accuracy Score = 93.32% The False Negative = 8 which means the Model predicted credit card risk as Low Risk but 
actually those are High risk. 
* The precision of prediction using this model:Low Risk(1) is 1 and High Risk(0) is 0.09.
* The recall(sensitivity) for predicting Low Risk is 0.94 and High Risk is 0.92 
* The F1 score for Low Risk is higher 0.97 and high risk is 0.16

## Summary

    There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
    There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)

Out of all the above Models, Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier seems to be best the Model to predict credit Risk. 
The Accuracy score is 95.03%. The False Negatives are only 8 it means Model predicted those low risk but those are 
high risk, compare to other models this model have lowest False Negative that way the High Risk credit wont out number 
the Low Risk credits. The sensitivity(Recall) for prediction low risk is 94% and High risk is also good which is 92%. 
The F1 score for low risk is 97%. My recommendation is to use Ensembleclassifier to predict credit risk where chances 
of high risk will be caught in the model and chances of LendingClub loosing money/loan will be less.
